## My process

This was a complicated challenge in this learning path. The page looks deceptively simple, but there were a lot of challenges:
- the first section with images overflowing a grid-area, and the dynamic reordering of all these elements. The SVG numner image. The overlay in the footer. Many challenges, but learned a lot!

I estimated to be done in 4 hours, but ended up a multiple!

My workflow:

- [x] Study Figma file and design guide
- [x] Create Git repo and connect to VSC repo
- [x] Update workflow in README.md
- [x] Copy reset.css file
- [x] Create styles.css file
- [x] CSS
  - [x] Build list of variables in :root
  - [x] Create fluid font sizes and spacing with Utopia (if design allows)
- [x] HTML
  - [x] Header
    - [x] Link reset.css
    - [x] Link styles.css
  - [x] Body
    - [x] Create anchors (main, header, footer)
    - [x] Structure content based on the design file
    - [x] Put content in sections
    - [x] Add CSS classes with BEM notation to the sections
    - [x] Develop CSS content for mobile. Work from elements high in the tree to elements lower in the tree.
    - [x] CSS Content for other formats
- [x] Test and iterate
- [x] Publish and solve links
- [x] Update README.md
